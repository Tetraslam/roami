### Changed

- Streamlined header and control components
- Updated routing to only handle passenger mode

### Voice Recording Implementation
- Successfully implemented manual voice recording in passenger mode with the following key insights:
  1. **State Management**:
     - Use refs (`transcriptRef`) instead of state for transcript collection
     - Avoid storing transcript in state to prevent unnecessary re-renders
     - Keep recording state minimal (just `isRecording`, `error`, and `recognition`)

  2. **Common Pitfalls Avoided**:
     - Don't use `continuous = false` as it auto-stops after silence
     - Don't update state on every `onresult` event to avoid UI jank
     - Don't send transcript multiple times during recording session

  3. **Best Practices**:
     - Clear transcript at the start of each new recording session
     - Only send complete transcript when manually stopped
     - Proper cleanup on unmount

  4. **Error Handling**:
     - Ignore 'no-speech' errors as they're common and non-critical
     - Properly cleanup resources on error
     - Maintain recording state even if recognition ends unexpectedly
