     - Don't send transcript multiple times during recording session

  3. **Best Practices**:
     - Clear transcript at the start of each new recording session
     - Only send complete transcript when manually stopped
     - Proper cleanup on unmount

  4. **Error Handling**:

   - `run.py`: Development server runner
   - `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

2. **Routers**:
   - `ai.py`: AI services (Cerebras, Moondream)
   - `location.py`: Location services (OpenStreetMap)
   - `media.py`: Media handling (music, photos)
   - `auth.py`: Firebase authentication

3. **Testing**:

   - Firestore message persistence

3. **AI Integration**:
   - Cerebras llama3.1-8b for chat
   - Moondream for image analysis
   - Tool-based response system

### Critical Implementation Details

1. **Message Handling**:
   ```typescript
   // Message structure in Firestore
   interface ChatMessage {
     id: string;
     userId: string;
     type: 'user' | 'ai';
     content: string;
     timestamp: Timestamp;
     hasImage?: boolean;
     imageUrl?: string;
   }
   ```

2. **Voice Recording**:
   ```typescript
   // Key configuration in usePassengerVoiceRecording
   recognition.continuous = true;
   recognition.interimResults = true;
   recognition.lang = 'en-US';
   ```

3. **AI Response Processing**:
   ```python
   # Tool schema structure
   TOOLS = [
     {
       "type": "function",
       "function": {
         "name": "get_location",
         "description": "Get current location or search for a place",
         "parameters": {...}
       }
     },
     # Additional tools...
   ]
   ```

### Important Safeguards

1. **Firebase Operations**:

   - Don't use raw Firestore operations
   - Don't store sensitive data in client
   - Don't forget error boundaries

2. **Voice Recording**:
   - Don't use `continuous = false`
   - Don't update state on every result
   - Don't forget proper cleanup

3. **AI Integration**:
   - Don't expose API keys
   - Don't ignore tool call validation
   - Don't forget to handle errors

### Next Development Focus
